# github-webhook-filter

A webhook filter for [Deno](https://deno.land/) that filters GitHub events before forwarding them to
a Discord webhook, reducing noise.\
Additionally, it attempts to handle Discord ratelimits and resend the webhook events if needed,
instead of just dropping the requests like GitHub does.

Certain no-op events (which Discord would ignore anyway) and common CI bots are ignored by default;
see [configuration](#configuration) below for more.

## Usage

0. Host the project somewhere, for example https://deno.com/deploy. Remember to add the environment
   variables you may want to set, see [`lib/config.ts`](./lib/config.ts).
1. Create a Discord webhook (`https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1234/ABCDWXYZ`).
2. Take the ID (`1234`) and token (`ABCDWXYZ`) from the URL, and enter
   `https://<filter_url>/1234/ABCDWXYZ` (note: no `/github`) in the GitHub webhook settings:\
   ![settings](./.github/assets/github-settings.png)
3. Optionally add configuration parameters (see below) to the URL, e.g.
   `?allowBranches=master,dev&hideTags=1`.
4. ????
5. Profit!

## Configuration

Additional options can be configured per URL:

- Only forward events from specific branches (`allowBranches`, simplified wildcard syntax)
  - `abc*xyz` is equivalent to `/^(abc.*xyz)$/`
  - `stuff,things` is equivalent to `/^(stuff|things)$/`
  - `!oh*hi*there` is equivalent to `/^(oh.*hi.*there)$/` inverted
- Ignore tag updates (`hideTags`)
- Ignore burst PR review comments in a short timespan, only showing the first x comments per review
  (`commentBurstLimit`)
